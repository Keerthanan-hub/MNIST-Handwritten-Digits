This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset provided in CSV format. Each digit image is represented by 784 pixel values, corresponding to a 28 × 28 grayscale image, along with a label indicating the digit class (0–9).

The dataset is preprocessed by:
* Normalizing pixel values to improve model performance
*Reshaping the flattened pixel data into 28 × 28 image format suitable for CNN input

The CNN model is built and trained using TensorFlow, and its performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset to measure accuracy and classification effectiveness.
This project highlights the practical application of deep learning techniques for image classification and serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to CNNs using structured CSV data.
